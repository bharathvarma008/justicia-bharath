3. Clause 9 of the said MOU provided that the DMK group shall be entitled to exclusive possession of first, fourth and sixth floor of new incomplete 6/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw construction and the CMK shall be entitled to exclusive possession of second and third floor of the new incomplete building standing in portion shaded green on the plan of the said property. It was provided that the CMK group shall vacate and hand over possession of the said second and third floors in the aforesaid new incomplete construction on payment by DMK group of a sum of Rs.30 lacs for which DMK group shall get credit towards the sum of Rs. 55 lacs payable under clause 3 of the MOU. It is not in dispute that the CMK has handed over the possession of the second and third floor in the said building as recorded in clause 9 of the MOU. Clause 12 of the MOU provided that each of the parties shall develop the portion of the said property coming to him in such a way not to prejudice and affect the FSI available to the other party as provided in clause 4 and each party shall supply to the other copies of the building plans before they are lodged with the Bombay Municipal Corporation.

Clause 27 of the said MOU provided that the dispute or difference between the DMK Group and the CMK Group or between any persons within a particular group or any person claiming by or under them or as to any clause or provision shall be referred to the sole arbitration of Mr. Pratapsinh Mathuradas Vissanji. The respondents by their advocates letter dated 17 th December, 1984 to the Advocates for the petitioner, conveyed their desire to pay the balance amount of Rs. 35 lacs to the petitioners in the first week of January, 1985 against the petitioner handing over the vacant possession of the second and third floor of the new construction as provided in clause 9 and vacant possession of the portion of the property coming to the share of the respondents as provided in clause 3.

4. The Petitioners vide their advocate's letter dated 11th January, 1985 contended that the arrangement regarding the suit property recorded in the said MOU was integral scheme and if only one clause was sought to be implemented the whole scheme would collapse causing irreparable damage to the petitioner.

The Petitioner refused to accept the bank draft of Rs. 30 lacs which was proposed 8/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw to be tendered to the petitioners by the respondent in the meeting proposed to be held on 11th January, 1985.

5. The dispute arose between the parties. DMK group filed arbitration suit No. 1196 of 1985 in this court under section 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 for seeking appointment of the arbitrator in terms of the arbitration agreement contained in clause 27 of the said MOU. By an order dated 8 th July, 1985, Mr. Pratapsinh Mathuradas Vissanji was appointed as sole arbitrator named in the arbitration agreement. The agreement for reference was also entered into between the parties. The arbitrator was empowered to ig make such orders and give such directions as he may deem fit including final orders. The learned arbitrator was also given summary power to make the award. The arbitration proceedings commenced in the month of August, 1985. On 4th September, 1985, DMK filed an application for interim relief and sought directions against the petitioners to vacate and hand over possession of the second and third floor in the said incomplete structure against payment of Rs. 30 lacs On 10 th September, 1985, the learned arbitrator directed the CMK to hand over possession of the second and third floor and directed DMK to deposit bank draft of Rs. 30 lacs with him. The respondents handed over bank draft of Rs. 30 lacs to the learned arbitrator. On 17th September, 1985, the CMK group handed over vacant possession of the second and third floor in the said incomplete structure to DMK group.

6. On 4th December, 1985, the learned arbitrator made interim non speaking award declaring that the petitioners (CMK Group) committed breach and or willful default of their obligations under clauses 7 and 9 of the said MOU. The 9/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw Petitioners who had returned the bank draft of Rs. 30 lacs were at liberty to take it back from the arbitrator whenever they desire. The Petitioners were directed to hand over to the respondents vacant possession of the portion of the suit premises shaded green on the plan annexed to the said MOU and directed the respondents to simultaneously hand over to the petitioners vacant possession of the portion shaded yellow on the said plan.

7. The Petitioners were directed to pay to the respondents an amount of Rs.31,20,000/- as compensation at the rate of Rs.10,000/- per day from 5 th December, 1985 till the date of handing over the vacant possession of the said area shaded green to the respondents. The learned arbitrator also directed that petitioner to pay an amount of Rs.3,75,000/- to the respondents as expenses referred to in clause 10 of the said MOU.

8. Being aggrieved by the said award, CMK group filed arbitration petition (4 of 1986) in this court under section 30 read with section 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940. By an order and judgment dated 5 th October, 1998 passed by this court, the said award was partly set aside. The direction given by the learned arbitrator in clause 1, 10 and 12 of the said award were quashed and set aside by which the learned arbitrator had declared that CMK had committed breach and/or willful default or had failed in fulfilling their obligations under clause 7 and 9 of the said MOU and had directed payment of compensation in the sum of Rs.31,20,000/- in view of alleged willful default in clause 7 of the MOU and payment of Rs.3,75,000/- towards bungalow and other expenses in terms of 10/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw clause 10 of the said MOU. Being aggrieved by the said order and Judgment of this court, the CMK group filed an appeal No. 621 of 2010 in this court. By consent of parties, the Division Bench of this court in Appeal No. 621 of 2000 set aside the order and judgment passed by the learned Single Judge of this court in Arbitration Petition No. 4 of 1986 and the said petition was remitted back to the learned Single Judge for hearing and decision in accordance with law.

9. Both the parties agreed that the petition can be decided on the basis of same pleadings which were already on record and were granted liberty to file compilation of documents.

10. It is not in dispute that the prayers (a) to (e) of the statement of claim filed by the DMK group against CMK group that is for partition, sub division, construction of compound wall, ascertainment of the total FSI for development of the property in such a way not to prejudice and or affect the FSI available to the claimant is being agitated and is subject matter of the arbitration before Shri Justice B.N. Shrikrishna, former Judge of the Supreme Court and the said proceedings are pending.

11. The Petitioner has thus pressed this petition inter alia impugning the directions and declaration made by the learned arbitrator in paragraphs 1, 8 and 10 to 12 of the impugned award by which the learned arbitrator declared that the CMK had committed breach and/or willful default or have delayed in fulfilling their obligations under clause 7, 10 to 12 and have directed the CMK group to 11/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw make payment of compensation at the rate of Rs.10,000/- per day and payment of Rs.3,75,000/- towards bungalow and other expenses.

12. Mr. Cooper, the learned counsel for the petitioner submits that main object of the MOU was to divide and/or partition the said immovable property by metes and bounds so that the both groups should have physical possession and ownership of their respective share in the suit property with both parties having their respective portion in FSI in respect of the immovable property. It is submitted that the purpose and object of the MOU was that both the parties would utilize the vacant portion ig with FSI for beneficial enjoyment of their respective portion by carrying out development after sub division of the property.

It is submitted that unless CMK group would have got vacant possession of the portion in possession of the DMK group, unless substantial portion of existing structure of two third portion which come to the share of DMK Group was demolished, and unless the property was subdivided and the portion of two third coming to the share of DMK group would have been demolished after sub division and submission of plans to the Corporation, both the parties would not have beneficial enjoyment of FSI or utilization in respect of their respective portion for development. It is submitted that thus the offer of sending amount by DMK group to CMK group without sub division of the property and without demolition of their respective portions, would not have been implemented in piecemeal. The learned counsel submits that it is not in dispute that both the parties had appointed their respective architects for making application to the Municipal Corporation for sub division of the plot. The learned Arbitrator also had issued various directions in that regard for effecting sub division by obtaining 12/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw permission from the Municipal corporation. The learned counsel submits that till today, the property has not been sub divided for want of permission from the Municipal Corporation. The learned counsel submits that the Municipal Corporation as on today has rejected the proposal of the sub division on 23 rd May, 2012 and communicated the said order to the consultants. It is submitted that the issue of partition of the entire property is subjudice in ongoing arbitration before Mr. Justice B.N. Shrikrishna, former Judge of the Supreme Court. It is submitted that thus there was no question of any willful default or delay on the part of CMK group in performance of their obligation under clause 7 of the MOU.

13. Mr. Cooper then submits that the parties cannot enjoy FSI unless possession is handed over simultaneously by both the parties, the existing structure is demolished, the property is subdivided and plan is sanctioned. It is submitted that Rs. 55 lacs agreed to be paid by the DMK Group to CMK group included 30 lacs for giving up their rights in new building. It is submitted that the ownership includes FSI and FSI is admittedly not available till today. The learned counsel submits that the area in possession of DMK group consumes larger FSI and they are enjoying occupation and possession of the new building.

It is submitted that no loss is caused to the respondents even if the portion of the suit property in occupation of CMK was not handed over. It is submitted that no time is provided under the contract for making the FSI available to the other parties. It is submitted that part of the obligation under clause 7 of the MOU could not have been implemented in isolation. It is submitted that the clauses of the MOU have to be read together. Mr. Cooper submits that the intent of the 13/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw parties was to get FSI and CMK group cannot get FSI unless sub division was done and property was demolished. It is submitted that no time is specified for handing over the possession under clause 8 of the MOU. It is submitted that even today there is uncertainty about the proposal of sub division made by the parties before the Municipal Corporation. The learned counsel submits that unless it was proved that the petitioner had committed willful default and unless it was proved that the respondents suffered any loss because of any such alleged willful default and such loss was proved, the learned arbitrator could not have directed the petitioner to pay such compensation which was in the nature of penalty. The respondents did not prove that the amount of Rs.10,000/- per day mentioned in MOU was a reasonable compensation.

14. Mr. Cooper, the learned counsel placed reliance on the judgment of this court in case of ONGC Vs. Country Tabular delivered by Anoop V. Mohta, J.

2011 (5) BCR 198 and submits that this court after considering the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Fateh Chand Vs. Balkishan Dass, AIR 1963 SC 1405, Maula Bux Vs. Union of India, AIR 1970 SC 1955 and several other judgments delivered by the Supreme Court including the judgment in the case of Oil & Natural Gas corporation Ltd. Vs. Saw Pipes Ltd. 2003(5) SCC 705 has held that reasonable compensation cannot be equated with fixed amount and or maximum amount as liquidated damages. It is held that the burden is always on the party who claims compensation to prove the actual loss caused even for reasonable compensation. The learned counsel placed reliance on Paragraphs 11, 13 to 15, 22 to 26, 32, 36, 39, 48(f) and (g) of the said judgment which read thus :

14/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw "11. The parties have executed a commercial agreement having relevant Clause 11 as under:- Failure and Termination Clause/ Liquidated Damages Time and date of delivery shall be essence of the contract. If the contractors fails to deliver the stores, or any installment thereof within the period fixed for such delivery in the schedule or at any time repudiates the contract before the expiry of such period, the purchaser may, without prejudice to any other right or remedy, available to him to recover damages for breach of the contract.

a) Recover from the Contractor as agreed liquidated damages and not by way of penalty, a sum equivalent to 1% (One percent) of the contract price of the whole unit per week for such delay or part thereof (this is an agreed, genuine pre-

estimate of damages duly greed by the parties) which the contractors has failed to deliver within the period fixed for delivery in the schedule, where delivery thereof is accepted after expiry of the aforesaid period. It may be noted that such recovery of liquidated damages may be upto 10% of the contract price of whole unit or stores which the contractor has failed to deliver with in the period fixed for delivery, or ..........

e) It may further be noted that clause (a) above provides for recovery of liquidated damages on the cost of contract price of delayed supplies (whole unit) at the rate of 1% (One Percent) of the contract price of the whole unit per week for such delay or part thereof upto a ceiling of 10% of the contract price of delayed supplies (whole unit) liquidated damages for delay in supplies thus accrued will be recovered by the paying authorities of the purchaser specified in the supply order, from the bill for payment of the cost of material submitted by the contractor or his foreign principles in accordance with the terms of supply order or otherwise.

f) Notwithstanding anything stated above, equipment and materials will be deemed to have been delivered only when all its components, parts are also delivered. If certain components are not delivered in time the equipments and material will be considered as delayed until such time all the 15/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw missing parts are also delivered.

13. The Petitioners, unilaterally deducted the maximum amount as per the clause. Therefore, the Respondents challenged the same and claimed refund.

14. Admittedly, both the parties led evidence before the learned Arbitrator, through its respective witnesses before 23rd February, 2002. The Petitioners' led evidence to prove losses suffered by them, though they were unable to prove the actual loss or quantum of loss fully but submitted to retain the amount already deducted. On the other hand, the Claimants (Respondents) led evidence to support their case that the Petitioners suffered no losses. Both the parties in fact acted upon and conducted the Arbitration Proceedings based upon the contemporary law.

The legal position prior to Saw Pipes (Supra)

15. The legal position with regard to the necessity of proof of actual loss by the party who entitled to claim maximum compensation as per liquidated damages clause, have been as under:-

      The follow up of Saw Pipes-


22. The Respondents' counsel submitted that, all these Supreme Court Judgments though referred in Fateh Chand (Supra), but not dealt with specially the issue of burden of proof of actual loss and/or actual loss need to be proved even where there is a stipulated liquidated damages clause. In all those matters, facts and circumstances are totally different and distinguishable. The principle so laid down by Fateh Chand, Maula Bux (Supra), Raman Iron Foundry has never been disturbed. It is law of the land on the issue.

The preference to pre-estimated/fixed amount over to unascertained amount is binding.

23. It is necessary to note that the Supreme Court in Sir Chunilal V. Mehta and Sons Ltd. v. Century Spinning and Manufacturing Co. Ltd.

MANU/SC/0056/1962 : AIR 1962 S.C. 1314 (5 Judges) has no occasion to deal with this aspect of proving actual loss, in the case of preestimated amount as per liquidated damages clause. That was judgment where the Supreme Court has observed that the parties who claimed and agreed for specified amount as liquidated damages/compensation, is excluded from and/or have no right to claim unascertained damages. But, in the present case, Clause 11 itself reserve the rights of the Petitioners to claim unascertained damages in addition to the claim of liquidated damages. That was a case of prefixed monthly amount. This is further followed in Steel Authority (Supra) in para 18(V). There was no issue of leading evidence to prove loss of actual damages.

24. In the present case, the parties have actually laid evidence, as that was the requirement of the law at the relevant time. But after Saw Pipes (Supra) by filing the additional arguments, the submissions were made that no evidence is necessary and/or actual loss need not be proved by the parties to claim benefit of the liquidated damages clause. The subsequent judgment Saw Pipes (Supra), itself is not sufficient to overlook the 19/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw actual material available on record, as parties have led the evidence to support their rival contentions. The Petitioners cannot be permitted to blow hot and cold, to disturb the valid and legal reasoned award.

25. The learned Arbitrator, therefore, based upon the material available on record Relied on the 5 Judges judgment Fateh Chand (Supra) and has passed the award in the following words.

" 19. ...

In both these cases what is payable by the party committing breach of the contract to the other party is only reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount of liquidated damages in one case and the amount stipulated by way of penalty in the other. The five judges Bench has clearly interpreted Section 74 of the contract Act and held that even where a contract containing a stipulating for payment of liquidated damages in case of breach the party complaining of the breach would be entitled only to reasonable compensation and the amount of liquidated damages specified in the contract would be the upper limit of the reasonable compensation as in the case of a stipulation by way of penalty. Section 74 has clearly equated a stipulation for payment of liquidated damages in case of breach of a contract to a stipulation by way of penalty and placed both the stipulations on the same footing.

20. ...

The decision of the five judges Bench is very clear on this point and I must, therefore, hold, despite the decision in Saw Pipes case that even where there is a stipulation in the contract for payment of liquidated damages for breach of the contract, the party which has suffered by the breach is entitled to recover by way of compensation from the party not exceeding the amount specified by way of liquidated damages. It is obvious that the decision of the five judge bench in Fateh Chand case must prevail over the decision of two judge bench in Saw Pipes 20/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw case and the decision in Fateh Chand case cannot be Distinguished by ignoring the first part of Section 74.

21. The Claimant also Relied on the decision of three judge Bench in Maula Bux v. Union of India MANU/SC/0341/1969 : AIR (1970) SC

417. This decision clearly placed the burden of proving the actual loss or damage on the party complaining of breach, subject to the maximum upper limit contemplated in the contract and further held that the distinction between liquidated damages and penalty is eliminated by Section 74 of the Contract Act.

24 The decision of the Division Bench in Raman Foundry's case in regard to the interpretation and application of Section 74 cannot, therefore, be regarded as overruled by the subsequent three judge Bench's decision in M/S. Kamaluddin's case. The ratio of the decision in Raman Foundry case therefore stands unaffected and must be regarded as binding on any subsequent two judge Bench of the Supreme Court unless overruled by a larger Bench.

26 It is clear from the aforesaid judgment that the Privy Council also took the view that whether the stipulation in a contract be by way of penalty or by way of liquidated damages, the party suffering as a result of the breach can recover only the damages which it has suffered.

27 It is, therefore, clearly laid down by a series of decisions of the highest authority that even if a contract provides for payment of liquidated damages in case of breach, the aggrieved party can recover only the actual damages suffered by it and consequently it would have to prove the actual damage suffered by it and cannot rely merely on the provision for liquidated damages contained in the contract.

33 It is in the light of this settled legal position that I must proceed to consider the facts of the present case. There is no doubt as I have already 21/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw pointed out in the preceding paragraph of this Award, that the Claimant failed to deliver both the consignments of 5" Casing Pipes to the Respondent within the respective time limits specified in the Contract and was accordingly liable to pay damages to the Respondent, but having regard to the judgments which I have Discussed above as also the specific provision contained in Section 74, it is impossible to see how the Respondent could claim to retain the entire amount of US$42,260.87 as liquidated damages.

39 It is clear and I do not wish to repeat what I have already said before, that the Respondent was not entitled to recover any liquidated damages from the Claimant but was entitled to claim only reasonable compensation from the, Claimant for late delivery of the consignments of 5" Casing Pipes. The question therefore, is whether the Respondent has proved whether any loss or damage was caused to it by reason of late delivery of the two consignment of 5"

Casing Pipes and if so, what is the extent of such loss or damage.

41 The Respondent also claimed from the Claimant damages on the basis of an affidavit filed by witness Mr. SRK Pandey. Mr. Pandey produced two statements which were marked Exhibit 1 and 2. The statement Exhibit 1 contained various corrections and erasures and Mr. Pandey, therefore, subsequently substituted that statement by making a further affidavit.

The Respondent relied upon these two statements, Exhibits 1 & 2 produced by Mr. Pandey. There is in my opinion nothing to establish the correctness or veracity of the entries contained in these two statements. Even if these two statements are accepted as correct, they do not establish that the Respondent had to purchases 5" Casing Pipes from the market at a price higher than the contract price resulting into pecuniary loss. It is clear from the written statement as also from the evidence of Mr. Pandey that the entire requirement of Casing Pipes for the year was worked out in advance 22/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw 12 to 14 months before and arrangements were made to obtain the stocks of such Casing Pipes with the result that if at any time during the year some quantity of Casing Pipes was not available, it could always be supplied from the existing stock so that no loss or damage occurred to the Respondent. There can be no doubt that the Respondent had a stock of 5"

Casing Pipes whether of 5" or 7" because a large stock had been purchased as far back as 1973 and it was not exhausted until 1997. The Respondent could have, therefore, used Casing Pipes out of this existing stock whether of 5" or 7", but presumably the Respondent did not require the same. Where the Respondent required Casing Pipes for carrying on the drilling activities, the Respondent did use 2463 Metres of higher grade 110 5" Casing Pipes but obviously did not require any Casing Pipes for any further operations under the contract. It is, therefore, to my mind clear that apart from the loss or damage claimed to have been suffered by the Respondent in respect of 2568 Metres of 5" Casing Pipes the Respondent did not suffer any loss or damage in respect of other Casing Pipes forming the subject matter of the contract.

42 I am, therefore, of the view that the Respondent was entitled to recover from the Claimant only a sum of US$4852.11 that is Rs.

1,96,510.45 at the current rate of exchange of 1 USD equal to Rs. 40.50 being the excess price in respect of 2463 Metres of higher grade P110 5" Casing Pipes but was not entitled to recover any further amount from the Claimant in respect of the remaining 5" Casing Pipes. The Respondent, however, recovered from the Claimant a sum of US$42,260.87 by retaining that amount from the price payable to the Claimant which in my view the Respondent was not entitled to retain except for the amount of US$4852.11 that is Rs. 1,96,510.45.

42 I would, therefore, direct the Respondent to refund to the Claimant forthwith the amount of Rs. 15,15,554.78 being equivalent of US$37408.76 at the current rate of exchange, 23/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw namely Rs. 40.50 per US $ together with interest thereon at the rate of 9 per cent per annum from the date of this Award until payment. Each Party will bear and pay its own cost of this arbitration.

The Arbitrator has allowed the claim partly. On merit found that the Petitioners suffered no loss, except as awarded.

The scope and power under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act of the Court to interfere or not to interfere

26. The Court, under Section 34 needs to see the scope and power to interfere with the award if it is based upon the decision of larger bench Fateh Chand (Supra) specially, when the parties themselves actually followed the law, prior to the Saw Pipes (Supra) and lead the evidence to support the claims and the defense respectively, including to prove and/or to disprove the actual loss.

The Arbitral Tribunal is bound by law of Precedent and/or ratio decided:

32. Considering Sections 73 and 74 of the Contract Act read with Sections 101, 102 and 103 of the Evidence Act, burden is normally on the Plaintiff/claimant to prove the claims/losses which he has suffered, and is always relevant to grant damages. Therefore, if failed to discharge the burden/onus, for want of lack of pleadings and evidence, the Court may refuses to grant any damages to such party. Draupadi Devi and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors.

MANU/SC/0728/2004 : (2004) 11 SCC 425

36. It is also necessary to note that adjudication of a dispute/entitlement is different than assessing the quantum of liquidated damages. Both are important. Kailash Rani Dang v. Rakesh Bala Aneja and Anr.

MANU/SC/8396/2008 : (2009) 1 SCC 732 Even Saw Pipes (Supra) has recognized the importance of leading evidence to prove damages or reasonable compensation

39. In view of above, the findings given by the 24/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw learned Arbitrator that the law so laid down in Fateh Chand (Supra) and followed by others, is good law as specifically dealt with, on the foundation of Sections 73 and 74 of the Contract Act read with Sections 101 to 104 of the Evidence Act, that the burden to prove actual loss lies upon the party or who claimed the damages or compensation, even in cases of the liquidated damages, cannot be stated to be bad in law or contrary to the law.

48 (f) The clause entitled the Petitioners ONGC or any such person to claim preestimated or fixed amount, ranging from 1% to 10; maximum of the value of the sum equivalent of the contract price for whole unit per week of such delay or part thereof. That itself mean the Court or the learned Arbitrator, on the basis of the evidence and the documents, may direct or order to pay reasonable compensation. This clause nowhere provides that the Arbitrator must award the maximum amount only. Such clause cannot be read and/or interpreted to mean that 10% is the maximum fixed or preestimated amount, as contemplated in Chunilal (Supra) and as contended by the Petitioners. The concept of the preestimated or the agreed fixed amount is different than the amount liable to be awarded between an upper and a lower limit. By this contractual term range is fixed and not the amount.

(g) In Saw Pipes (Supra), the Apex Court has observed that the party who relied upon such clause, may lead evidence to claim more, if the damage/compensation amount is not reasonable. The Court may also direct the parties to lead evidence to confirm that the action of delay amounts to breach of contract and which has caused the damages and therefore, entitled for a reasonable compensation/ amount. The reasonable amount/ compensation cannot be equated with the fixed amount and/or maximum amount as per the liquidated damages clause in question. The observations that other side to prove that the claimant has not suffer any loss or damage itself contemplates necessity of leading evidence by both the parties. The burden is always on the parties who claimed compensation to prove actual loss, even for the reasonable compensation. The other doctrines; "Mitigation of loss", "Burden of Proof", "Onus of 25/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw proof" and "Shift of burden" just cannot be overlooked by the Court or the Arbitrator, while determining the reasonable compensation."

15. Mr. Cooper submits that the clause under consideration of the Supreme Court in the case of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. Vs. Saw Pipes Ltd.

(supra) clearly shows that it was agreed that the recovery from the contractor as liquidated damages was not by way of penalty. It was also agreed that sum equivalent to 1% of the contract price was agreed genuine pre-assessment of damages. The learned counsel submits that clause in question in this case is totally different and does not record any agreement that sum of Rs. 10,000/- per day is not in the nature of penalty or that it is agreed genuine pre-assessment of damages. It is submitted that thus the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of ONGC would not apply to the facts of this case. Paragraphs 38, 46, 47, 48, 49, 64 to 68 of the said judgment in the case of ONGC read thus :

"38. At this stage, we would refer to the relevant terms of the contract upon which learned counsel for the appellant has based his submission which are as under:--
"11. Failure and Termination Clause/Liquidated Damages:--
Time and date of delivery shall be essence of the contract.
If the contractor fails to deliver the stores, or any installment thereof within the period fixed for such delivery in the schedule or at any time repudiates the contract before the expiry of such period, the purchaser may, without prejudice to any other right or remedy, available to him to recover damages for breach of the contract:--
(a) Recovery from the contractor as agreed liquidated damages are not by way of penalty, a sum equivalent to 1% (one percent) of the contract price of the whole unit per week for such delay or part thereof (this is an agreed, 26/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw genuine pre-estimate of damages duly agreed by the parties) which the contractor has failed to deliver within the period fixed for delivery in the schedule, where delivery thereof is accepted after expiry of the aforesaid period. It may be noted that such recovery of liquidated damages may be upto 10% of the contract price of whole unit of stores which the contactor has failed to deliver within the period fixed for delivery, or

(c) It may further be noted that Clause (a) provides for recovery of liquidated damages on the cost of contract price of delayed supplies (whole unit) at the rate of 1% of the contract price of the whole unit per week for such delay or part thereof upto a ceiling of 10% of the contract price of delayed supplies (whole unit). Liquidated damages for delay in supplies thus accrued will be recovered by the paying authorities of the purchaser specified in the supply order, from the bill for payment of the cost of material submitted by the contractor or his foreign principals in accordance with the terms of supply order or otherwise.

(f) Notwithstanding anything stated above, equipment and materials will be deemed to have been delivered only when all its components, parts are also delivered. If certain components are not delivered in time the equipment and material will be considered as delayed until such time all the missing parts are also delivered.

12. Levy of liquidated damages (LD) due to delay in supplies.

LD will be imposed on the total value of the order unless 75% of the value ordered is supplied within the stipulate delivery period. Where 75% of the value ordered has been supplied within stipulated delivery period. LD will be imposed on the order value of delayed supply(ies). However, where in judgment of ONGC, the supply of partial quantity does not fulfill the operating need, LD will be imposed on full value of the supply order.

34.4 Delay in Release of Payment:--

In case where payment is to be made on satisfactory receipt of materials at destination or where payment is to be made after satisfactory commissioning of the equipment as per terms of the supply order. ONGC shall make payment within 60 days of receipt of invoice/claim complete in all respects. Any delay in payment on undisputed claim/amount beyond 60 days of the receipt of invoice/claim will attract interest @ 1% per month. No 27/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw interest will be paid on disputed claims. For interest on delayed payments to small scale and Ancillary Industrial Undertakings, the provisions of the "Interest of delayed payments to small scale and Ancillary Industrial Undertakings Act, 1993 will govern.

46. From the aforesaid Sections, it can be held that when a contract has been broken, the party who suffers by such breach is entitled to receive compensation for any loss which naturally arise in the usual course of things from such breach. These sections further contemplate that if parties knew when they made the contract that a particular loss is likely to result from such breach, they can agree for payment of such compensation. In such a case, there may not be any necessity of leading evidence for proving damages, unless the Court arrives at the conclusion that no loss is likely to occur because of such breach. Further, in case where Court arrives at the conclusion that the term contemplating damages is by way of penalty, the Court may grant reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount so named in the contract on proof of damages. however, when the terms of the contract are clear and unambiguous then its meaning is to be gathered only from the words used therein. In a case where agreement is executed by experts in the field, it would be difficult to hold that the intention of the parties was different from the language used therein. In such a case, it is for the party who contends that stipulated amount is not reasonable compensation, to prove the same.

47. Now, we would refer to various decisions on the subject. In Fateh Chand's case (supra), the plaintiff made a claim to forfeit a sum of Rs. 25000/- received by him from the defendant. The sum of Rs. 25000/- consisted of two items--Rs. 1000/- received as earnest money and Rs. 24000/- agreed to be paid by the defendant as out of sale price against the delivery of possession of the property. With regard to earnest money, the Court held that the plaintiff was entitled to forfeit the same. With regard to claim of remaining sum of Rs. 24000/-, the Court referred to Section 74 of Indian Contract Act and observed that Section 74 deals with the measure of damages in two clauses of cases (i) where the contract names a sum to be paid in case of breach, and (ii) where the contract contains any other stipulation by way of penalty. The Court observed thus:--

"The measure of damages in the case of breach of a 28/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw stipulation by way of penalty is by Section 74 reasonable compensation not exceeding the penalty stipulated for. In assessing damages the Court has, subject to the limit of the penalty stipulated, jurisdiction to award such compensation as it deems reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case. Jurisdiction of the Court to award compensation in case of breach of contract is unqualified except as to the maximum stipulated; but compensation has to be reasonable, and that imposes upon the Court duty to award compensation according to settled principles. The section undoubtedly says that the aggrieved party is entitled to receive compensation from the party who has broken the contract, whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused by the breach. Thereby it merely dispenses with proof of "actual loss or damages"; it does not justify the award of compensation when in consequence of the breach no legal injury at all has resulted, because compensation for breach of contract can be awarded to make good loss or damage which naturally arose in the usual course of things, or which the parties knew when they made the contract, to be likely to result from the breach.

The Court further observed as under:--

... Duty not to enforce the penalty clause but only to award reasonable compensation is statutorily imposed upon courts by Section 74. In all cases, therefore, where there is a stipulation in the nature of penalty for forfeiture of an amount deposited pursuant to the terms of contract which expressly provides for forfeiture, the court has jurisdiction to award such sum only as it considers reasonable, but not exceeding the amount specified in the contract as liable to forfeiture."

48. From the aforesaid decision, it is clear that the Court was not dealing with a case where contract named a sum to be paid in case of breach but with a case where the contract contained stipulation by way of penalty.

49. The aforesaid case and other cases were referred to by three Judge Bench in Maula Bux's case (supra) wherein the Court held thus:--

"...It is true that in every case of breach of contract the person aggrieved by the breach is not required to prove actual loss or damage suffered by him before he can claim a decree, and the Court is competent to award reasonable compensation in case of breach even if no actual damage is proved to have been suffered in consequence of the breach of contract. But the expression "whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have 29/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw been caused thereby" is intended to cover different classes of contracts which come before the Courts. In case of breach of some contracts it may be impossible for the Court to assess compensation arising from breach, while in other cases compensation can be calculated in accordance with established rules. Where the Court is unable to assess the compensation, the sum named by the parties if it be regarded as a genuine pre- estimate may be taken into consideration as the measure of reasonable compensation, but not if the sum named is in the nature of a penalty. Where loss in terms of money can be determined, the party claiming compensation must prove the loss suffered by him.

64. It is apparent from the aforesaid reasoning recorded by the arbitral tribunal that it failed to consider Sections 73 and 74 of Indian Contract Act and the ratio laid down in Fateh Chand's case (supra) wherein it is specifically held that jurisdiction of the Court to award compensation in case of breach of contract is unqualified except as to the maximum stipulated; and compensation has to be reasonable. Under Section 73, when a contract has been broken, the party who suffers by such breach is entitled to receive compensation for any loss caused to him which the parties knew when they made the contract to be likely to result from the breach of it. This Section is to be read with Section 74, which deals with penalty stipulated in the contract, inter alia [relevant for the present case] provides that when a contract has been broken, if a sum is named in the contract as the amount to be paid in case of such breach, the party complaining of breach is entitled, whether or not actual loss is proved to have been caused, thereby to receive from the party who has broken the contract reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount so named. Section 74 emphasizes that in case of breach of contract, the party complaining of the breach is entitled to receive reasonable compensation whether or not actual loss is proved to have been caused by such breach. therefore, the emphasis is on reasonable compensation. If the compensation named in the contract is by way of penalty, consideration would be different and the party is only entitled to reasonable compensation for the loss suffered. But if the compensation named in the contract for such breach is genuine pre-estimate of loss which 30/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw the parties knew when they made the contract to be likely to result from the breach of it, there is no question of proving such loss or such party is not required to lead evidence to prove actual loss suffered by him. Burden is on the other party to lead evidence for proving that no loss is likely to occur by such breach. Take for illustration: if the parties have agreed to purchase cotton bales and the same were only to be kept as a stock-in-trade. Such bales are not delivered on the due date and thereafter the bales are delivered beyond the stipulated time, hence there is breach of the contract. Question which would arise for consideration is--whether by such breach party has suffered any loss. If the price of cotton bales fluctuated during that time, loss or gain could easily be proved. But if cotton bales are to be purchased for manufacturing yarn, consideration would be different.

65. In Maula Bux's case (supra), plaintiff--Maula Bux entered into a contract with the Government of India to supply potatoes at the Military Head Quarters, U.P. Area and deposited an amount of Rs. 10000/- as security for due performance of the contract. He entered into another contract with the Government of India to supply at the same place poultry eggs and fish for one year and deposited an amount of Rs. 8500/- for due performance of the contract.

Plaintiff having made persistent default in making regular and full supplies of the commodities agreed to be supplied, the Government rescinded the contracts and forfeited the amounts deposited by the plaintiff, because under the terms of the agreement, the amounts deposited by the plaintiff as security for the due performance of the contracts were to stand forfeited in case plaintiff neglected to perform his part of the contract. In context of these fats, Court held that it was possible for the Government of India to lead evidence to prove the rates at which potatoes, poultry, eggs and fish were purchased by them when the plaintiff failed to deliver "regularly and fully" the quantities stipulated under the terms of the contracts and after the contracts were terminated. They could have proved the rates at which they had to be purchased and also the other incidental charges incurred by them in pronouncing the goods contracted for. But no such attempt was made. Hence, claim for damages was not granted.

66. In Maula Bux's case (supra) , the Court has specifically held that it is true that in every case of breach of contract the person aggrieved by the breach is not required to prove actual loss or damage suffered by him before he can claim a decree and the Court is competent to 31/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw award reasonable compensation in a case of breach even if no actual damages is proved to have been suffered in consequence of the breach of contract. The Court has also specifically held that in case of breach of some contracts it may be impossible for the Court to assess compensation arising from breach.

67. Take for illustration construction of a road or a bridge. If there is delay in completing the construction of road or bridge within stipulated time, then it would be difficult to prove how much loss is suffered by the Society/State. Similarly in the present case, delay took place in deployment of rigs and on that basis actual production of gas from platform B-121 had to be changed. It is undoubtedly true that the witness has stated that redeployment plan was made keeping in mind several constraints including shortage of casing pipes. Arbitral Tribunal, therefore, took into consideration the aforesaid statement volunteered by the witness that shortage of casing pipes was only one of the several reasons and not the only reason which led to change in deployment of plan or redeployment of rigs Trident-II platform B-121. In our view, in such a contract, it would be difficult to prove exact loss or damage which the parties suffer because of the breach thereof. In such a situation, if the parties have pre- estimated such loss after clear understanding, it would be totally unjustified to arrive at the conclusion that party who has committed breach of the contract is not liable to pay compensation. It would be against the specific provisions of Section 73 and 74 of the Indian Contract Act. There was nothing on record that compensation contemplated by the parties was in any way unreasonable. It has been specifically mentioned that it was an agreed genuine pre- estimate of damages duly agreed by the parties. It was also mentioned that the liquidated damages are not by way of penalty. It was also provided in the contract that such damages are to be recovered by the purchaser from the bills for payment of the cost of material submitted by the contractor. No evidence is led by the claimant to establish that stipulated condition was by way of penalty or the compensation contemplated was, in any way, unreasonable. There was no reason for the tribunal not to rely upon the clear and unambiguous terms of agreement stipulating pre- estimate damages because of delay in supply of goods. Further, while extending the time for delivery of the goods, respondent was informed that it would be required to pay stipulated damages.

68. From the aforesaid discussions, it can be held that:-- (1) Terms of the contract are required to be taken into consideration before arriving at the conclusion whether the 32/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw party claiming damages is entitled to the same;

(2) If the terms are clear and unambiguous stipulating the liquidated damages in case of the breach of the contract unless it is held that such estimate of damages/compensation is unreasonable or is by way of penalty, party who has committed the breach is required to pay such compensation and that is what is provided in Section 73 of the Contract Act.

(3) Section 74 is to be read along with Section 73 and, therefore, in every case of breach of contract, the person aggrieved by the breach is not required to prove actual loss or damage suffered by him before he can claim a decree. The Court is competent to award reasonable compensation in case of breach even if no actual damage is proved to have been suffered in consequence of the breach of a contract.

(4) In some contracts, it would be impossible for the Court to assess the compensation arising from breach and if the compensation contemplated is not by way of penalty or unreasonable, Court can award the same if it is genuine pre- estimate by the parties as the measure of reasonable compensation."

16. Mr. Cooper submits that the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Oil & Natural Gas corporation Limited Vs. Saw Pipes Ltd. (supra) has been dealt with by the learned Single Judge of this court (Mohta Anoop V.J.) in the case of Oil & Natural Gas Corporation limited Vs. Oil Country Tubular Limited, 2011 (5) Bom.C.R. 198 and has interpreted the said judgment.

17. Mr. Cooper, learned counsel then submits that in so far as direction given by the learned arbitrator that the petitioners have committed willful default under clause 7 and has to hand over vacant possession of one third portion to the respondent is concerned, the said part of the impugned award is totally perverse. It is submitted that though admittedly the respondents have not handed over possession of their respective portion to the petitioner, the application for subdivision of the plot was pending at the relevant time, plans were not sanctioned, building was not demolished, it was not 33/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw possible to avail of any FSI, thus the learned arbitrator could not have given direction in para 8 of the impugned award to hand over vacant possession to either parties in this situation. It is submitted that the reliefs claimed by the respondent in the ongoing arbitration relates to the partition of the entire property including portion coming to the respective share of the parties, sub division, construction of compound wall, ascertainment of FSI and development of the property by using the FSI in such a way not to prejudice or affect the FSI available to the claimant and thus in view of such larger reliefs which are subject matter of the ongoing arbitration, it would be more appropriate that the impugned directions given by the learned arbitrator of the respective portion to both the parties is set aside and the arbitral tribunal which is seized of the matter.

even this issue be dealt with by

18. Mr. Rustomjee, the learned senior counsel for the respondents on the other hand submits that the petitioner had already offered to pay the amount agreed in the said MOU in the month of December, 1984 itself to the petitioners by advocate's notice and had agreed to comply with their part of obligation, however, petitioners refused to hand over possession thereof. It is submitted that under the provisions of the MOU, both the parties were entitled to enjoy ownership rights in respect of the suit premises. It is submitted that the petitioners having admittedly refused to hand over possession of their one third portion to respondents though respondents offered compensation in respect thereof, the learned arbitrator was justified in issuing direction in para 8 of the award for handing over vacant possession and in para 10 and 11 for payment of compensation in view of such willful default and/or delay on the part of the petitioners in performance of their obligation under clause 7 of the said MOU. The learned senior counsel submits that the learned arbitrator was admittedly empowered to exercise summary powers. The learned arbitrator has rendered non speaking award. The court can not probe into the 34/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw mind of the arbitrator. It is submitted that the learned arbitrator was appointed by consent of both the parties and was relative of one of the petitioner. Under Section 30 read with section 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, the scope of challenge is very limited. The learned counsel placed reliance upon the judgment of the Privy Council in the case of Champsey Bhara & Co. Vs. Jivraj Balloo Spinning Co. AIR 1923 PC 588 at page 593. It is submitted that the arbitrator is sole and final Judge of all questions of law and facts referred to him and only exceptions are the cases where there is corruption, fraud or error of law apparent on the face of record.

19. The learned counsel placed reliance upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in the following judgments in support of the plea that scope of section 30 is limited and the court shall not interfere with the award :

1. Sudarshan Trading Co. Vs. Government of Kerala (1989) 2 SCC 38
2. State of Orissa & Ors. Vs. Lall Brothers (1998) 4 SCC 153.
3. Hind Builders Vs. Union of India (1990) 3 SCC 338
4. P.V. Subba Naidu Vs. Government of Andhra Pradesh (1998) 9 SCC 407
5. Bhagwati Oxygen Vs. Hindustan Chopper (2005) 6 SCC 462
6. Ashok Kashyap V. Sudha Vasisht (1987) 1 SCC 717
7. Sardar Singh Vs. Krishna Devi (1994) 4 SCC 18
8. N. Khosla Vs. Rajalakshmi (Dead) and Ors. (2006) 3 SCC 605.
20. The learned senior counsel submits that the respondents have already complied with their part of obligation by tendering bank draft of Rs. 30 lacs which was returned by the petitioners. The whereabouts of the said bank draft is not known. The respondents are already out of pocket by Rs.30 lacs plus interest thereon. It is submitted that out of 35/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw payment of Rs. 55 lacs agreed to be paid under the aid MOU, the respondents have already made payment of Rs. 50 lacs. The learned senior counsel placed reliance upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of ONGC Vs. Saw Pipes (supra) and submits that the amount of Rs. 10,000/- per day agreed to be paid by the petitioners to the respondents in the case of willful default is a reasonable compensation and is not in the nature of penalty. It is submitted that even if the contention of the petitioner was that the said clause was in the nature of penalty, onus was on the petitioners to prove the same. It is submitted that the ancestral immovable property was to be handed over by the petitioners to the respondents and thus the loss in terms of money could not have been ascertained. It is submitted that both the parties have presumed that it is pre-

assessment loss and was reasonable compensation. It is submitted that the petitioner did not lead any evidence to prove that it was not reasonable compensation. In view of the fact that the MOU permitted the respondent to deal with the property, the petitioners were bound to hand over possession of their respective portion to the respondents once the respondents agreed to comply with their part of obligation and having failed to do so, it was willful default on the part of the petitioner and consequently the petitioners became liable to pay the agreed pre-assessment compensation to the respondents. It is submitted that the loss has been suffered and proof would be required only if the petitioners would have proved that it was in the nature of penalty and quantum was not reasonable compensation. The learned senior counsel distinguished the judgment delivered by the Single Judge of this court (Anoop V. Mohta,J.).

21. The learned senior counsel also distinguished the judgment of this court in the case of Jagson International Vs. Oil & Natural Gas, 2004 (2) Bom. C.R. 272 delivered by the Single Judge of this court. Reliance is placed on Para 9 to 11 of the said Judgment. The learned counsel submits that the judgment delivered by the learned Single 36/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw Judge in that case is contrary to the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of ONGC Vs. Saw Pipes. Para 9 to 11 of the said judgment read thus :

"9. All the judgments of the Supreme Court referred to by the learned counsel for both the sides have been considered by the Supreme Court in its judgment in the case of SAW Pipes Ltd. 's case. In that case, the Supreme Court has considered the provisions of Section 74 also because in that case, the party had alleged that the amount of damages which was mentioned in the contract was in the nature of penalty. Therefore, really speaking, it is not necessary to refer to these judgments. So far as the judgment of the Division Bench of Kerala High Court in the case of State of Kerala and others vs. M/s United Shippers and Dredgers Ltd. is concerned, it has mainly considered the term 'whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused thereby' and held that as reasonable compensation is required to be paid, the party claiming the damages has to prove that it has suffered loss and it is incapable of being exactly computed. That law, in my opinion, has been laid down by the Division Bench of the Kerala High Court after referring to the judgments in the cases of Mania Bux, Rampur Distillery and Chemical Co. Ltd. as also in the case of Fateh Chand. All these judgments have been considered by the Supreme Court in its judgment in the case of SAW Pipes Ltd.'s case and therefore, in my opinion, it is not necessary to refer to the judgment of the Kerala High Court also. Before me, submissions were made on the provisions of Section 74 of the Contract Act also. Section 74 reads as under :-
"74. Compensation for breach of contract where penalty stipulated for. --When a contract has been broken, if a sum is named in the contract as the amount to be paid in case of such breach, or if the contract contains any other stipulation by way of penalty, the party complaining of the breach is entitled, whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused thereby, to receive from the party who has broken the contract reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount so named or, as the case may be, the penalty stipulated for."
It becomes clear from the perusal of the provisions of Section 74 quoted above that these provisions operate in relation to the contract (i) where an amount is mentioned in the contract as the amount to be paid in case of breach of contract; (ii) where the contract contains any other stipulation by way of penalty and (iii) where the actual amount of damages cannot be quantified. In the present case, in the contract it is provided that an amount of Rs.
30,00,000/- for each rig was liable to be recovered for breach of the contract and it is also not anybody's case that in this matter 37/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw that the amount of actual loss suffered by the ONGC it was not capable of being computed and therefore, in my opinion, provisions of Section 74 were not attracted in the present case. The Supreme Court has considered the provisions of Section 74 in its judgment in the case of Maula Bux referred to above. In paragraph 8 of the said judgment, the Supreme Court observes thus:--

"It is true that in every case of breach of contract the person aggrieved by the breach is not required to prove actual loss or damage suffered by him before he can claim a decree and the Court is competent to award reasonable compensation in case of breach even if no actual damage is proved to have been suffered in consequence of the breach of contract. But the expression 'whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused thereby' is intended to cover different classes of contracts which come before the Courts. In case of breach of some contracts it may be impossible for the Court to assess compensation arising from breach, while in other cases compensation can be calculated in accordance with established rules. Where the Court is unable to assess the compensation, the sum named by the parties if it be regarded as a genuine pre-

estimate may be taken into consideration as the measure of reasonable compensation, but not if the sum named is in the nature of a penalty. Where loss in terms of money can be determined, the party claiming compensation must prove the loss suffered by him."

It is thus clear that Section 74 comes into play in relation to a contract where it is impossible for the Court to assess compensation arising from the breach as distinguished and as distinct from contract where the amount of compensation can be computed in accordance with established rules. In order to attract the provisions of Section 74 of the Contract Act, the other party will have to claim and prove that the loss suffered by the first party is not capable of being computed. In the present case, it is nowhere even claimed by the Company that the loss suffered by the ONGC is not capable of being computed. Therefore, the provisions of Section 74 of the Contract Act are not attracted in the present case. It is governed by the provisions of Section 73 of the Contract Act.

10. Insofar as the submission of the learned counsel appearing for ONGC that the amount of Rs. 60,00,000/- is the amount of earnest money is concerned, I do not propose to consider this submission in detail in view of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of ONGC vs. SA W Pipes Ltd. (supra).

11. Insofar as the present case is concerned, it is nowhere the case of the Company that in case of the present contract, it was impossible to assess the compensation arising from the breach. On the contrary, the observations of the Arbitrators in the award 38/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw show that according to the Arbitrators, it was possible for the ONGC to place before the Court actual amount of damages suffered by the ONGC and therefore, in my opinion, the provisions of Section 74 were not attracted in the present case.

On the basis of the pleadings of the parties and the material on record, the case was governed by the provisions of Section 73 and therefore, the Arbitrators were obliged to hold that the ONGC was entitled to the amount of Rs. 60,00,000/- which it had received by invoking the bank guarantees and therefore the claim made by the Company was liable to be rejected. It is clear that for attracting the provisions of Section 73 of the Contract Act, following three factors are to be established - (1) the contract has been breached and as a result one party has suffered loss; (2) that loss is capable of being computed in terms of money and (3) in the contract there is a pre-estimate of damages. Once these factors are established, the matter is governed by the provisions of Section 73 of the Contract Act and the party who has suffered loss become entitled to the amount of the pre-estimated damages mentioned in the contract. In the present case, all these factors have been established, therefore the ONGC was entitled to the amount of Rs. 30,00,000/- for each rig, which was the amount mentioned in the contract. In the result therefore, arbitration petition No. 53 of 2001 is rejected, arbitration petition No. 153 of 2001 is allowed, the award dated 13th November 2000 challenged in that petition is set aside and for the above mentioned reasons, the claim made by the Company before the Arbitrators is rejected."

22. Mr. Rustomjee, also made an attempt to distinguish the judgment of the Division Bench of this court in the case of Board of Trustees of Port Vs. Pioneer Engineer and anr. 2006 (5) Bom C.R. 628. The learned counsel submits that even the said judgment delivered by the Division Bench of this court is contrary to the view taken by the Supreme Court in the case of ONGC Vs. Saw Pipes. The relevant paragraphs of the judgment of the Division Bench in the case of Board of Trustees (supra) are as under :

"13. In this connection, Mr. Nadkarni took us to Clause 9.7.1 of the said agreement. It reads thus:
Liquidated damages 9.7.1. If the Contractor shall fail damages to complete the Works within the for delay time prescribed by Clause 9.3 here- of or extended time then the Con-tractor shall pay to the Board the sum stated in part II as liquidated damages and not as a penalty for such default for every week or part of a week which shall elapse be-tween the time prescribed by Clause 9.3 of extended time as the case may be and the completion of the Works. The Board may with out prejudice to any other method of 39/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw recovery deduct the amount of such damages from any amounts in its hand's due to which may become due to the Contractor.

Provided that the total amount of such damages to be paid shall not exceed the sum stated in Part II. The payment of such damages shall not relieve the Contractor of his obligation to complete the works or form any other of his obligations or liabilities under the Contract.

20. Mr. Dessai, on the other hand, submitted that Clause 9.7.1 of the said contract providing for liquidated damages is a penalty clause within the meaning of Section 74 of the Contract Act. He submitted that the sum mentioned in the said clause is not pre- estimated, genuine liquidated damages duly agreed by the parties. Mr. Dessai heavily relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Feteh Chand's case. He submitted that in that case, it is held by the Supreme Court that Section 74 of the Contract Act lays down an uniform principle as far as stipulation naming liquidated damages and stipulation by way of penalty are concerned. He submitted that it is held by the Supreme Court that the principle of "reasonable compensation' has to be uniformly applied. He submitted that the judgment in Fateh Chand's case is still good law. ONGC's case has made no dent in it. Mr. Dessai submitted that if the present case is examined in the light of the said judgment, the impugned award cannot be faulted. He further submitted that in the Minutes dated 13.10.86, there is no admission made by respondent 1. In any case, the arbitrators have duly considered the minutes and it is not open for this Court to sit in appeal over the award. Mr. Dessai submitted that the judgment of the Supreme Court in Sikkim Subba's case is not applicable to the present case. In that case, the arbitrator had reached his conclusions by throwing overboard well settled norms. It was a case of errors apparent on the face of the award. It was a case of misconduct on the face of the award. Such are not the facts here.

He submitted that the impugned award is perfectly legal and in consonance with settled principles. According to Mr. Dessai the learned Judge has rightly dismissed the petition.

21. To understand the moot question involved in this case, it is necessary to first refer to Fateh Chand's case. In that case, it was argued that the covenant which gave to the plaintiff the right to forfeit Rs. 2,400/- was a stipulation in the nature of penalty and the plaintiff could retain that amount only if he establishes that in consequence of the breach by the defendant he suffered loss and if it was found by the Court that that amount was reasonable compensation for that loss. The Supreme Court found that right to forfeit Rs. 2400/- was manifestly a stipulation by way of penalty. The Supreme Court observed that Section 74 of the Contract Act deals with measure of damages in two classes of cases, (i) where the contract names a sum to be paid in case of breach; and (ii) where the contract contains any other stipulation by way of penalty. Since the Supreme Court was dealing with a stipulation 40/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw by way of penalty, the Supreme Court clarified that measure of damages in case of breach of a stipulation by way of penalty is as per Section 74 of the Contract Act, reasonable compensation not exceeding the penalty stipulated for and the Court has jurisdiction to award compensation as is deemed reasonable in the circumstances, not exceeding the stipulated penalty. It is important to note that while coining to this conclusion, the Supreme Court distinguished the Indian Law from the English common law where liquidated damages and stipulations in the nature of penalty are separately treated and held that the Indian Legislature has sought to cut across the web of rules and presumptions under the English common law by enacting a uniform principle applicable to all stipulations naming amount to be paid in case of breach and stipulations by way of penalty. We may quote the relevant observations of the Supreme Court. They read thus:

The section is clearly an attempt to eliminate the somewhat elaborate refinements made under the English common law in distinguishing between stipulations providing for payment of liquidated damages and stipulations in the nature of penalty. Under the common law a genuine pre-estimate of damages by mutual agreement is regarded as a stipulation naming liquidated damages and binding between the parties: a stipulation in a contract in terrorem is a penalty and the Court refuses to enforce it, awarding to the aggrieved party only reasonable compensation. The Indian Legislature has sought to cut across the web of rules and presumptions under the English common law, by enacting an uniform principle applicable to all stipulations naming amounts to be paid in case of breach, and stipulations by way of penalty.

22. Further observations of the Supreme Court are very important and they have to be read in the context of the fact that the Supreme Court has put liquidated damages and stipulations by way of penalty on par. The Supreme Court has gone on to say that assumptions made by some of the High Courts that Section 74 applies only to cases where the party is seeking to receive some amount on breach of contract and not to cases where upon breach of contract an amount received under the contract is sought to be forfeited are not well founded. Following are the relevant observations of the Supreme Court:

It was urged that the section deals in terms with the right to receive from the party who has broken the contract reasonable compensation and not the right to forfeit what has already been received by the party aggrieved. There is however no warrant for the assumption made by some of the High Courts in India, that Section 74 applies only to cases where the aggrieved party is seeking to receive some amount on breach of contract and not to cases where upon breach of contract an amount received under the contract is sought to be forfeited.

The Supreme Court further observed that:

41/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw the section does not confer a special benefit upon any party; it merely declares the law that notwithstanding any term in the contract predetermining damages or providing for forfeiture of any properly by way of penalty, the Court will award to the party aggrieved only reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount named or penalty stipulated.

The Supreme Court clarified that the jurisdiction of the Court to award compensation in case of breach of contract is unqualified except as to the maximum stipulated, but compensation has to be reasonable and that imposes on the Court duty to award compensation according to settled principles.

23. After indicating that reasonable compensation is the principle underlying Section 74 of the Contract Act, the Supreme Court clarified that though Section 74 says that whether or not actual damage is proved, the aggrieved party is entitled to receive compensation thereby it only dispenses with proof of actual loss or damage. This does not justify the award of compensation when in consequence of the breach no legal injury at all has resulted, because compensation for breach of contract can be awarded only to make good loss or damage which naturally arose in the usual course of things or which the parties know when they made the contract to be likely to result from the breach. Extracts from the judgment in Fateh Chand's case have been quoted in later judgments of the Supreme Court with approval and there could be no dispute that Fateh Chand is still a good law and holds the field.

24. It is also necessary to refer to Maula Bux's case. In that case, the three Judge Bench of the Supreme Court was dealing with stipulation in the nature of penalty. It referred to Fateh Chand's case and affirmed the interpretation of Section 74 of the Contract Act made in that Judgment. The Supreme Court discussed the general principles of assessment of compensation as under: It is true that in every case of breach of contract the person aggrieved by the breach is not required to prove actual loss or damage suffered by him before he can claim a decree and the Court is competent to award reasonable compensation in case of breach even if no actual damage is proved to have been suffered in consequence of the breach of contract. But the expression 'whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused thereby' is intended to cover different classes of contracts which come before the Courts. In case of breach of some contract it may be impossible for the Court to assess compensation arising from breach, while in other cases compensation can be calculated in accordance with established rules. Where the Court is unable to assess the compensation, the sum named by the parties if it is to be regarded as genuine pre-estimate may be taken into consideration as the measure of reasonable compensation, but not if the sum named is in the nature of a penalty. Where loss in terms of money can be determined, the party claiming compensation must prove the loss suffered by him.

42/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw A reading of these two judgments lead to an inevitable conclusion that according to the Supreme Court Section 74 of the Contract Act has obliterated the distinction between the stipulations providing liquidated damages and stipulations in the nature of penalty, so far as payment of compensation is concerned. Reasonable compensation is the principle to be followed. The above observations in Maula Bux's case are applicable to both the stipulations. Therefore, even if it is accepted that we are concerned here with stipulation naming amount to be paid in case of breach and not stipulation by way of penalty, the principle of reasonable compensation will still be applicable to it. The measure and requirement of proof of damages will vary according to type of contracts. Where the loss in terms of money can be determined, the party claiming compensation must prove the loss suffered by him.

25. In the present case, the arbitrators have partially awarded liquidated damages by holding that the damages or loss, if any, could have been assessed and since damages were not proved, they cannot be granted. The arbitrators have, however, awarded liquidated damages to the extent of 50 % of the maximum permissible under Clause 9.7.1 of the contract. The award, thus, is in consonance with the judgments of the Supreme Court in Fateh Chand's case and Maula Bux's case. It would not be right to say that the arbitrators have acted as conciliators or that they have awarded liquidated damages as per their whims.

26. Mr. Nadkarni, however, insisted that in ONGC's case, the Supreme Court has analysed sections 73 and 74 of the Contract Act and has clearly stated the law that if the terms of the contract are clear, stipulating the liquidated damages in case of breach of the contract unless it is held that such estimate of damage/compensation is unreasonable or is by way of penalty, a party who has committed the breach is required to pay such compensation and in every case of the breach of contract, the person aggrieved by the breach is not required to prove actual loss or damage suffered by him before he can claim a decree and the Court is competent to award reasonable compensation in case of breach even if no actual damage is proved to have been suffered in consequence of the breach of contract.

27. We are unable to come to a conclusion that in ONGC's case, the Supreme Court has made a departure from its earlier view. In fact the Supreme Court has referred to Fateh Chand as well as Maula Bux's cases. It has extensively and without any reservation quoted relevant extracts from the said judgments. It has only stated that in Fateh Chand's case the Court was dealing with a situation where the contract contained stipulation by way of penalty. It has reiterated what was stated by it in Maula Bux's case. The concept of reasonable compensation has not been given a go-by. The ultimate conclusions drawn by the Supreme Court in this case can, in no way, be said to be contrary to what the 43/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw Supreme Court has stated in Fateh Chand's case and Maula Bux's case.

28. In fact, the conclusions drawn by the Supreme Court in ONGC's case are in consonance with Fateh Chand and Maula Bux. The Supreme Court has concluded in paragraph 69 that terms of the contract are required to be taken into consideration before arriving at the conclusion whether the party claiming damages is entitled to the same. The Supreme Court has further held that if the terms are clear and unambiguous stipulating the liquidated damages in case of breach of the contract unless it is held that such estimate of damages/compensation is unreasonable or is by way of penalty, the party who has committed the breach is required to pay such compensation as per Section 73 of the Contract Act. Therefore, the concept of reasonableness of compensation is reiterated by the Supreme Court even in case of liquidated damages. It is further stated that in every case of breach of contract, the person aggrieved by the breach is not required to prove actual loss or damage suffered by him before he can claim a decree and the Court is competent to award reasonable compensation even if no actual damage is proved to have been suffered in consequence of the breach. Therefore, the competence of the Court to determine reasonable compensation is accepted. It is also clear from the conclusion that there could be cases where a party is required to prove damages. It is further observed that in some contracts, it would be impossible for the Court to assess the compensation and if the compensation contemplated is not by way of penalty or unreasonable, the Court can award the same if it is genuine pre-estimate by parties as the measure of reasonable compensation. Here we are not concerned with a case where it is not possible to assess the compensation. Thus, the conclusions drawn by the Supreme Court in ONGC's case also reiterate that in case of breach of contract, reasonableness of compensation is the guiding principle whether stipulation is by way of penalty or stipulation naming liquidated damages and proof of loss will be necessary in some cases.

29. No doubt, on the facts before it, the Supreme Court has observed that if the compensation named in the contract for such breach is genuine pre-estimate of loss which the parties know when they made the contract to be likely to result from the breach of it, there is no question of proving such loss and the burden is on the party to lead evidence for proving that no loss is likely to occur by such breach. But these observations will have to be read in the context of the facts of that case. In that case, the relevant term of the contract stated that in case of breach of contract the purchaser could recover from the contractor as agreed liquidated damages and not by way of penalty, a sum equivalent to 1 % of the contract price or part thereof which the contractor had failed to deliver within the fixed period. It was further clearly stated that "this is an agreed, genuine pre-estimate of damages duly agreed by the parties". There was, therefore, an express agreement as 44/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw regards pre-estimated genuine liquidated damages and, hence, it was observed that there was no need to prove them. These observations, in our opinion, do not suggest that there is deviation from the view taken by the Supreme Court in Fateh Chand and Maula Bux.

30. Mr. Desai tried to distinguish ONGC's case by pointing out that ONGC's case is in relation to Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, which is quite different form Section 30 of the said Act. We do not want to go into this aspect, because in our opinion, ONGC's case has not laid down any new principle. It is in tune with Fateh Chand and Maula Bux's cases and the argument that Fateh Chand and Maula Bux's cases pertain to stipulation in the nature of penalty and, therefore, the principles laid down therein do not apply to liquidated damages, do not appeal to us. The dividing line between liquidated damages and stipulation in the nature of penalty in the matter of payment of compensation has been erased by the judgment in Fateh Chand's case. That has been accepted in Maula Bux's case and in ONGC case the Supreme Court has affirmed the principle of reasonableness of compensation and requirement of proof of damages in some cases. Viewed in the light of the above, we do not feel that the impugned award is based on illegal proposition of law."

23. On perusal of MOU entered into between the parties, it reveals that the suit property was agreed to be divided or partitioned by metes and bounds between two groups under the agreed proportion to enable both the parties to enjoy their respective portion by development by availing and utilizing the FSI thereon. Both the parties had agreed to simultaneously remove themselves from their respective portions. It is not in dispute that both the parties had agreed to make best efforts and cooperate with each other to obtain approvals, permissions sanctions from the authorities under ULC Act and also from B.M.C. It was also agreed that each party shall conform and shall be subject to rules and regulations of the BMC. It is not in dispute that both the parties had appointed their respective architects for making joint application for sub division of the suit properties. Unless the structures were demolished and property was sub divided in the records of the Municipal Council, after obtaining requisite permission from the Municipal Council, neither party could have developed their respective portion of 45/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw property. It is not in dispute that the newly constructed building was already occupied by the DMK group on payment of certain amounts to the petitioner. On perusal of the provisions of the said MOU, it is clear that various obligations cast on both the parties for surrendering possession to each other was with a view to ultimately divide the properties by metes and bounds, sub divide the properties according to provisions of the MOU with a view to finally develop the property by utilizing the available FSI thereon. Though various efforts were made even by the learned arbitrator by issuing various directions, property could not be subdivided so far. The last correspondence produced on record indicates that the application filed for sub division has been rejected by the Municipal Corporation.

24. It is also not in dispute that the larger reliefs which are subject matter of the arbitration and forming part of the statement of claim made by the DMK Group such as partition, sub-division, construction of compound wall, ascertainment of FSI, development of the property so as to protect rights of each other, including FSI in respect of the suit property, which includes property which is subject matter of the present petition is pending before the arbitral tribunal.

25. In my view, the learned arbitrator could not have directed the petitioner to pay compensation on the basis of alleged finding of fact that the petitioners committed willful default of their obligations under clause 7 of the MOU. The fact remains that both the parties are in possession of their respective portions held by them prior to the date of execution of the MOU. None of the parties could develop the property without sub-division, demolition, without sanction of plan and without ascertainment of the FSI.

In my view, the learned arbitrator ought to have considered the provisions of the MOU in toto with a view to ascertain the intention and object of the parties to execute the said 46/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw MOU.

26. On perusal of clause 7 of the said MOU it reveals that CMK group had agreed to procure in favour of DMK performance guarantee of Mr. Chandrakant Khatau guaranteeing performance by CMK group on the condition of that clause and guaranteeing payment of Rs.10,000/- per day in the event of any willful default or delay on the part of CMK group in performance of the said obligation. Clause 8 of the said MOU provided that giving of vacant possession by one party to another shall be simultaneous.

27. In my view on reading this clause as a whole with other obligations of parties and considering the intention and object of the executing of MOU, it reveals that the said clauses provided for payment of Rs.10,000/- per day is in the nature of penalty. The clause does not indicate that both the parties had agreed that the said amount was correct, genuine pre estimate of damages. The Supreme Court in the case of ONGC Vs. Saw Pipes (supra) has considered a clause by which both the parties had agreed that the purchaser would recover from the contractor as agreed liquidated damages and it was not by way of penalty sum equivalent to 1% of the contract price of the whole unit per week for such delay or part thereof. It was agreed that the said sum was genuine pre-

estimate of damages duly agreed by the parties. The Supreme Court construed such clause and held that it would be difficult to prove the exact loss or damage each party had suffered because of breach thereof and in such situation if the parties had pre estimated such loss after clear understanding, it would be unjustified to arrive at the conclusion that the party who had committed breach of the contract is not liable to pay compensation and it would be against the specific provisions of section 73 and 74 of the Indian Contract Act. The Supreme Court held that in the said clause, it was specifically 47/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw mentioned that it was agreed genuine pre estimate of the damages duly agreed by the parties. It was also mentioned that the liquidated damages was not by way of penalty.

With these facts under consideration, the Supreme Court held that there was no reason for the tribunal not to rely upon the clear and unambiguous terms of the agreement stipulating pre estimated damages caused for delay in supply of goods. The Supreme Court also considered that while extending the time for delivery of the goods, the respondent was informed that it would be required to pay stipulated damages. In paragraph 68 of the said judgment the Supreme Court it is held that the terms of the contract are required to be taken into consideration before arriving at the conclusion whether the party claiming damages is entitled to the same. If the terms are clear and unambiguous stipulating liquidated damages, unless it is held that such estimate of damages/compensation is unreasonable, or is by way of penalty, party who has committed the breach is required to pay such compensation and that is what is provided under section 73 of the Contract Act. The Supreme Court also held in some cases that it would be impossible for the court to assesss the compensation arising from breach and if the compensation contemplated is not by way of penalty or unreasonable, the court can award the same if it is genuine pre-estimate by the parties as the measure of reasonable compensation. The Supreme Court held that the Court is competent to award reasonable compensation in the case of breach even if no actual damage is proved to have been suffered in consequence of the breach of the contract.

28. The Division Bench of this court in the case of Board of Trustees of Port Vs. Pioneer (supra) has interpreted the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of ONGC Vs. Saw Pipes by holding that the observations made by the Supreme Court will have to be read in the context of the facts of that case. The Division Bench held that the view of the Supreme Court that there was agreed genuine pre-estimate of damage duly agreed 48/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw by the parties and there was no need to prove then was based on the relevant terms of that contract which stated that in the case of breach of contract purchaser can recover from the contractor as agreed liquidated damages and not by way of penalty sum equivalent to 1% of the contract price or part thereof on which the contractor had failed to deliver within the fixed period. In my view the clause considered by the Supreme Court in the case of ONGC Vs. Saw Pipes is totally different. It is the case of the respondent themselves that it is not possible to prove the loss suffered by the respondent, if any, in view of the petitioner not handing over the possession of their one third portion to the respondent. Even if the finding of willful default was correct, in and not the entire my view, the learned arbitrator at the most could have awarded reasonable compensation amount as calculated based on clause which is in the nature of penalty. None of the parties led any evidence before the learned arbitrator to prove as to what amount should be reasonable for grant of compensation. On perusal of the impugned award, it is clear that the learned arbitrator has awarded the entire amount of Rs. 10,000/- per day for the alleged willful default not only from 27 th January, 1985 to 4th December, 1985 but also from 5th December, 1985 till the petitioners hand over possession to the respondent vacant possession.

29. In my view, award of Rs.10,000/- per day as claimed which is in nature of penalty shows patent illegality on the face of award. Though the impugned award is a non speaking award, perusal of relief granted clearly reveals that the learned arbitrator had granted the entire relief as claimed by awarding Rs,10,000/- per day by way of compensation. In my view grant of such relief by way of compensation is contrary to the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Fatechand Vs. Balkishandas (supra) AIR 1963 SC 1405, Maulabux Vs. Union of India (supra), ONGC Vs. Saw Pipes, judgment of Single Judge of this Court in the case of O.N.G.C. Vs. Country Tabular and Jagson 49/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw Vs. O.N.G.C. (supra) and judgment of Division Bench in the case of Board of Trustees of Part Vs. Pioneer Engineer.

30. In my view as the error committed by the learned arbitrator in awarding the compensation at the rates as claimed though the said clause was in the nature of penalty, is error apparent on the face of the award, the arbitrator has committed legal misconduct in making the award, the court is empowered to interfere with the said award under section 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 even in the case of non speaking award.

Reliance thus placed by Mr. Rustomjee on nine judgments on the scope of section 30 read with section 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 is of no assistance to the respondents.

31. In my view as the larger reliefs claimed by the respondents such as partition of entire property, sub division, ascertainment of FSI, construction of compound wall and other similar reliefs related to the said property is subject matter of ongoing arbitration before Shri Justice B.N. Srikrishna, former Judge of Supreme Court, it would be appropriate if the impugned award which is subject matter of this petition and more particularly directions in paragraphs 1, 8, 10 and 11 are set aside and remitted back to the arbitral tribunal which is seized of the matter between the parties.

32. In so far as direction given by the learned arbitrator in Para 12 of the impugned award to pay sum of Rs.3,75,000/- as bungalow and other expenses is concerned, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner did not advance any submissions to canvass that the said part of the award also deserves to be set aside. In view thereof, no interference is warranted with the directions given by the learned arbitrator in para 12 of the impugned award.

33. I, therefore, pass the following order :

50/50 ARBITRATION PETITION NO. 4 OF 1986.sxw The impugned declaration/direction given by the learned arbitrator in paragraphs 1, 8, 10 and 11 are set aside and the matter is remitted back to the arbitral tribunal which is seized of the matter between the parties for decision afresh. Direction in paragraph 12 of the impugned award is upheld.

Petition is partly allowed in aforesaid terms. There shall be decree in terms of the award as modified aforesaid. There shall be no order as to costs.

(R.D. DHANUKA,J.)
